My goal is to add upon this almost two decade old client into a work of art. With its primitive technology, dissecting and modifying RO is one of my favorite hobbies. I'm enjoying everyone's feedback and suggestions so please keep them coming! Have fun on YYRO."

Helped porting the 3rd job classes as they were being released on kRO and recently came out of a RO hiatus. Now, I’m focused on developing new game modes and I’m excited to bringing these ideas to life!"
