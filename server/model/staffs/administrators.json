Since I started this project, I quickly fell in love with it, and now actively work towards improving YYRO every day. It makes me so incredibly happy to know that while I may not have gotten to enjoy to Ragnarok Online experience I wish I got, we're able to provide such an experience to our players."

        "description": "Hello, friends. I joined YYRO since its launch. I rolled with it and like it. I never imagined that the little project with no more than a handful of players would one day make it this far. Today, my tasks are some of the most varied among staff and if I had to describe what I do, I would say I dabble in everything. This server means a lot to me and I want to continue to see it succeed."

Such endeavours continue to be a big passion of mine, although today I also assist with anything that falls between support tickets and hat descriptions. Working alongside the many incredibly talented and ambitious people continue to be a great source of inspiration to me but more than anything, I want to pass on the joy of playing this game."
