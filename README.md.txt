# Capstone-Project

Hi Andrii: 

Currently, there is a bug on the home page, if you use the mobile view to view the home page, for some reason it shows a white gap on the right side of the screen. Spend some time to debug, could not figure out, but if you disable the mobile view, then adjust to 320px, there is no white gap.
Also, the code is a bit messy, I will clean up in the following week. Please consider these when you grade. Thank you so much.
